# Jobs Large Action Model (LAM) with Azure Cognitive Services and Arduino Integration

## Project Overview
The "Jobs" system is an advanced automation solution designed to enhance pet care by integrating Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services with physical hardware control using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE. This project aims to automate the process of letting a pet out onto a balcony using AI-driven decision-making based on real-time sensory data.

## Features
- **Azure Computer Vision**: Utilizes camera feeds to visually determine if a pet (specifically, a German Shepherd) is at the door and needs to go out.
- **Azure Speech Services**: Analyzes audio to detect barking or other indicative sounds to assist in decision-making.
- **Arduino Nano 33 BLE**: Manages the mechanics of opening and closing a door to allow the pet access to an outdoor area safely and autonomously.

## System Components
1. **Sensory Input**: Cameras and microphones positioned strategically to monitor the pet's behavior and location.
2. **Data Processing**: Sensory inputs are sent to Microsoft Azure where Computer Vision and Speech Services analyze the data.
3. **Command Execution**: Arduino Nano 33 BLE receives wireless commands to control a door mechanism based on Azure's processing results.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- Servo motor or electronic actuator for door control
- Camera and microphone setup capable of interfacing with Azure
- Basic electronic components (wires, resistors, power supply)

## Software Dependencies
- Arduino IDE for programming the Arduino
- Microsoft Azure subscription with access to Cognitive Services
- BLE libraries for Arduino

## Usage
1. Set up and connect all hardware as described in the hardware setup documentation.
2. Configure Azure Cognitive Services to process incoming data streams and determine action triggers.
3. Upload the Arduino sketch provided in this repository to the Arduino Nano 33 BLE.
4. Ensure your device is within range to receive BLE commands from your server or control system.
